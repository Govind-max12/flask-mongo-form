Flask + MongoDB Assignment

This project is a simple Flask web application integrated with MongoDB Atlas.
It contains a frontend form that allows users to submit their name and email.
The submitted data is stored in MongoDB Atlas and a success message is displayed upon submission.
The application also includes an /api route that reads data from a JSON file and returns it as a JSON response.
This assignment demonstrates basic CRUD operations, API handling, and Flaskâ€“MongoDB connectivity.
